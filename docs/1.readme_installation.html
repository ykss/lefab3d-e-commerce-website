            <h2>The Basics </h2>
            <p>
                You have downloaded the Zen Cart&reg; software for an online shopping cart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since you're reading this file, you have likely already unzipped the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files/" target="_blank">Zen Cart&reg; distribution file</a> and its contents into a folder on your personal computer. If for some reason you have not already done so, unzip the files to your PC now, retaining the file structure within the zip file.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a basic guide for new installations of Zen Cart&reg;. If you already have Zen Cart&reg; installed and wish to upgrade from a previous version, please see the <a href="./2.readme_how_to_upgrade.html">Upgrade Instructions</a> and the <a href="./index.html" target="_blank">What's New documentation</a>.

                                If your web hosting provider provides an FTP program that runs inside your browser, we recommend that you do NOT use that for uploading large amounts of files such as a fresh install of Zen Cart. Those are okay for single-file uploads, but unreliable for several files at once.

            <h1>Upload the Zen Cart&reg; Fileset</h1>
            <h2>How do I Upload Files?</h2>
            <p>
                Using FTP software, upload the whole Zen Cart&reg; fileset into a directory on your server. Example: <em>/catalog/</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use &quot;<em>/catalog/</em>&quot; as an example here. You can choose &quot;no&quot; foldername, or something else if you prefer, such as &quot;<em>/zencart</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>/store/</em>&quot; etc
            </p>
            <h2>What Folder do I Upload Into?</h2>
            <p>
                Each web hosting provider has their own preference in naming folders running a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can have many files that do not even get shown to the public. The ones that are available for access via a browser are usually in a folder called something like:
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                /home/YOURNAME/public_html
                <br> - or -
                <br> /var/www/YOURNAME/httpdocs
                <br> - or -
                <br> /usr/accounts/a/b/YOURNAME/httpd
                <br> - or -
                <br> - etc, etc, etc -
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, in your FTP software, look for a &quot;www&quot; or &quot;public_html&quot; or &quot;htdocs&quot; or &quot;httpdocs&quot; or &quot;wwwroot&quot; folder. These are the common folder names for what is referred to as the &quot;webroot&quot;, which is where all website content is served from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Zen Cart files need to be under that folder. If they are not, then you will get &quot;not found&quot; errors ... because the content is not found!
            </p>
            <p>
                If it is unclear where the publicly accessible files are to be uploaded, ask your web hosting provider for assistance.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Two files need to be created on the server. These are the configure.php files that identify the settings of your particular server and the location of the files that you just loaded. After they have been created, you will then need to change the permissions on these files.
                    <ol class="noteList">
                        <li>
                            Changing permissions can be done via your FTP program with the chmod feature.

                        <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        If using IIS for Windows hosting, the &quot;chmod 777&quot; idea for permissions settings is likely foreign to you. In IIS, under Windows, you need to right-click on the file (or folders in <a href="#mainFolderPermissions">the next section</a> below), and choose "Properties".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then under the Security tab, ensure that the&quot;<em><em>Internet Guest Account</em></em>&quot;, identified usually as: MACHINE_NAME\IUSR_MACHINE_NAME ... has at least &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; privileges ... likely best to give &quot;modify&quot; as well.

                    <li>
                        This should be done on each file/folder indicated.

                    <li>
                         &quot;_MACHINE_NAME&quot; above refers to the &quot;machine name&quot; or &quot;computer name&quot; configured by the server administrator to &quot;name&quot; the server.

                    Open the <em>/catalog/images</em> directory and change <em>ALL</em> of the subdirectories and their subdirectories to 777 as well. For example (this is a partial list):

                    <li>/catalog/images/dvd</li>

            <p>
                The installer is fairly intelligent and should be able to automatically supply answers to the questions listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will, however, need to confirm that the auto-detected answers are, in fact, correct as on some servers they may differ.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need the following information for the installation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>The    physical path to your new Zen Cart&reg; directory</em>
                    <br>
                    Example: /home2/zencart/public_html/catalog
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>The Virtual HTTP Path</em> (the URL to your domain and directory for your shop)
                    <br>
                    Example: http://www.mydomain.com/catalog
                </li>

        <div id="sslConsiderations">
            <h1>SSL Considerations</h1>
            <p>
                A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are installing onto a live webserver where you intend to process real transactions, you should plan on securing your customers' transaction data with SSL.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not already have an SSL certificate, talk to your web hosting provider about your available options. You will need to enter your SSL details as below. In most cases they will be correct, unless you are using a "shared SSL" service. Your web hosting provider can give you the correct details.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>The Virtual HTTPS Server</em> (the secure URL to your domain)
                    <br>
                    Example: https://www.mydomain.com
                    <ul class="small-string noStyle">
                        If you have a shared certificate on a virtual server this may look like:
                        <li>
                            https://mydomain.secureservername.net/
                        <li>
                     - or - 
                        <li>
                            https://secure.sharedservername.net/~username
                        <li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>The Virtual HTTPS Path</em> (the secure URL to your domain and directory for your shop)
                    <br> 
                    Example: https://www.mydomain.com/catalog
                    <br>
                     - or - 
                    <br>
                     https://secure.sharedservername.net/~username/catalog
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you are installing to a local PC or to a development server where you do not need to protect sensitive data, you can leave the SSL settings at their defaults, and when asked about enabling SSL later in the installation process, just leave it off if you are not on a live production server.

                        The Installer examine your server for compliance with technical requirements for running Zen Cart&reg;, presenting you with several items you may need or want to address with your host.

The image folders and others as described earlier in this document are also noted.

                        If a previous version of Zen Cart&reg; is found on your server, the installer will attempt to determine the database patch level and display that on the screen as well.

                    You will now want to change the permissions on the <em>configure.php</em> files with <em>chmod 644 or 444</em> depending on your server.

                            Sometimes setting 444 cannot be done via FTP, in which case, use your webhosting control panel or file manager to set the permissions level

                    It would also be a good idea to download a copy of these files to your computer from the server as they have been setup and configured to your server specifications based on the Installation process.

                    The Zen Cart&reg; Installer includes base directives equivalent to <em>".htaccess"</em> rules to help secure your store.
