            </h1>
            <p>
                Zen Cart&reg; v1.5.5 is designed for PHP 5.6 to 7.1, with MySQL 5.1 thru 5.7 and Apache 2.2/2.4
            </p>
            <p class="small-string">
                It is compatible with PHP 5.2.10 through PHP 7.1, for backward-compatibility while upgrading your site, but you should be using a newer version whenever possible. As of the time of writing this, <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php" target="_blank">PHP 5.6 is considered obsolete.</a> and you should be using <em> PHP 7.1 or greater</em>.

                Upgrade Instructions
            </h1>
            <p>
                This document only mentions the actual changes specific to v1.5.5 since v1.5.4.
            </p>
            <h2>
                From v1.5.4
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you are    already using v1.5.4 and <em>*have NOT customized or altered*</em> any of the files listed in the changed_files-v1-5-5.html document, then simply replace those files with the new files as listed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you <em>*have customized or altered*</em> certain files, simply re-do your customizations in the new version of those particular files by making the same changes needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using Addons/Plugins that have made alterations to those files, it is best to compare those changed files against the original Zen Cart files for the version those plugins were built for, and see what changes were there ... and then re-build those changes in the v1.5.5 file.
            </p>

                To v1.5.5 from v1.5.3 or older

            <p>
                If you are upgrading from a version OLDER than v1.5.4, then please do a <a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/upgrades" target="_blank">standard site upgrade</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to review all the links in this article, including tips on staging the upgrade in a separate directory/folder.

                Important Note About configure.php Files
            </h1>
            <p>
                The contents of <em>configure.php</em> have been simplified ... and they are MUCH SMALLER now! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>dist-configure.php</em> shows the simplified contents, and zc_install will generate the leaner files (when doing fresh installs).
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, zc_install will upgrade your <em>configure.php</em> files to the new format as long as the files are writable by your server's PHP.

        <div>
            <h1>
                A Note About the New Template
            </h1>
            <p>
                While Zen Cart&reg; v1.5.5 contains a newer "responsive_classic" template, we <em>STRONGLY</em> recommend that upgraders first upgrade the site using everything (including template_default) <em>EXCEPT</em> the contents of responsive_classic template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then once the upgraded site is working properly you can consider what changes you might want to make to your own active template. 
            </p>
            <p>
                (Important notes about <em>template_default</em> are shown below)
            </p>
            <p>
                AGAIN: The responsive_classic template should NOT be implemented immediately as part of an upgrade; it should be a separate step ... if it is even used at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not <em>NECESSARY</em> to use responsive_classic <em>ON YOUR EXISTING SITE</em>, and you should <em>UPGRADE THE REST OF YOUR SITE FIRST</em> before attempting to convert/adapt it for use.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h1>
                Notes About Changes to template_default
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Upgrading Notes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Upgraders should ensure they update <em>*BOTH*</em> template_default <em>*AND*</em> your custom template as described here:
            </p>
            <p>
                In Zen Cart the <em>template_default</em> directory contains the master copy of all storefront page templates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The normal procedure for customizing template files for use in your own personalized template is to make a copy of the corresponding file from    template_default, put it into your own template folder (and matching folder structure), and make your customizations in that copy of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                This way the only files you need in your personalized template folder are those that you have altered in some way from template_default.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that explained, it is important that whenever you upgrade your site, you should also inspect ALL the template_default files to determine which changes in those files need to be replicated in your customized files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Often a tool like <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php" target="_blank">Beyond Compare</a> or Araxis Merge or GnuDiff can be helpful for this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The process is simple: compare the template_default directory files from your <em>*old*</em> version against the template_default files in the <em>*new*</em> version, and use those results as a reference to copy those updated changes into each of the files you have customized in your custom/personalized template in your store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, and only after you have done all those comparisons and updated your customized files in your custom template folder, you will copy the template_default files from the new version into the template_default directory of your store. This way you will be left with updated personalized files <em>*and*</em> updated template_default files.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Changes in template_default for v1.5.5
            </h2>
            <p>
                The template_default files previously had a lot of old <em>&lt;table&gt;</em> markup to specify widths, cell borders and padding and spacing.
            </p>
            <p>
                These have been removed in v1.5.5 and relevant styles added to the bottom of the main stylesheet.css file.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will want to add the updated    CSS parts to your own stylesheet if your custom template still uses those tables. (A few 3rd-party templates have aggressively ripped out various tables and may not be affected by this change.)
            </p>
            <p>
                A few CSS changes were made in <em>template_default</em> to change IDs of repeating elements to be classes instead.    Of note, <em>"#cartDisplay"</em> is now <em>".cartDisplay"</em>, and <em>"#cartImage"</em> is now <em>".cartImage"</em>.
